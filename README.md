# Slack chat

Communication is divided into channels. Each channel is a separate chat where users can communicate with each other. On the left, you will see a full list of available channels that you can join. And you can also create your own channel. By default, you are automatically added to #general. This is a general channel for communication of all users. In the messages section, you can send private messages to other people who are registered in our chat.
